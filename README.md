The Train Engine
============
A modular game engine by C63 Industries.

The idea behind the Train Engine is to have a variety of objects that can be mixed together to create a variety of games.

The libraries of the Train Engine are a mix of C/C++ libraries and .NET libraries written in C++/CLI.  The .NET libraries use Safe MSIL Common Language RunTime support which allows them to be compatiable with Mono.

The solution and project files can be opened with:
* Visual Studio 2010 SP1
* Visual Studio 2012
* Visual Studio 2013

In order to compile the projects, you will also need to have Visual C++ 2008 Express (or Visual Studio 2008) installed.  This is because the C++/CLI projects use the v90 platform toolset which is the latest version that can be run using Mono.

You can download Visual C++ 2008 Express for free from:
